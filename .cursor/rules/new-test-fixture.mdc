When a new test fixture is added to the project, you should work through the following protocol:

1. Run tests on the new fixture to idenitfy any failures in parsing compared to the provide "expected" json.

2. Optionally write dedicated debugging scripts to facilitate iterative testing and implementation.

3. Update the parsing code to address test failures, bringing the parsing output closer to the "expected." Note that the "expected" json has been maunally curated to defined the desired output. Do not alter the "expected" json. You can propose an edit to the json if you think the parsing output is actually an improvement upon the "expected", but this proposal must the presented to the user for approval.

4. Once the new test fixture passes, then run all test fixtures to identify any regressions or new failures. Continue to iteratively debug until all tests pass.

5. Confirm that schema, lint and formatting tests pass as well, such that the repo is ready for a new commit and push.

6. Summarize the fixes required to accomodate the new test fixture. Update any relevant repo docs if the changes impact them, e.g., the README and changelog.
