## Recent Major Improvements (v0.3.0)

### üéØ **Parsing Accuracy Enhancements**
- **Fixed truncated highlights**: Removed arbitrary 40-line scanning limits, work section now properly extends until Education section
- **Enhanced column detection**: Better left/right column separation prevents content mixing
- **Improved location detection**: Added support for major cities (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, etc.) and complex location formats
- **Better content filtering**: Removed overly aggressive publication filtering that incorrectly excluded legitimate job descriptions

### üìä **Data Quality Improvements**
- **Structured highlights**: Workshop titles, data types, and technical content now properly separated into individual highlights instead of massive single lines
- **Automatic capitalization**: First letter of each highlight properly capitalized
- **Healthcare content recognition**: Medical terminology (Critical care, ambulatory care, etc.) no longer incorrectly filtered out
