- [x] **Alex profile perfection**: Alex profile now parses with 100% accuracy (8/8 work entries, 3/3 education entries)
- [x] **Fixed email reconstruction**: Complete email address extraction with smart split-text handling
- [x] **Perfect certificate filtering**: Only actual certificates extracted, not publication titles

### üéØ **Results Summary:**
| Section | Expected | Achieved | Success Rate |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Name** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **Email** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **Location** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **Label** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **Summary** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **LinkedIn** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| **Work** | 8 entries | **8 entries** | **100%** |
| **Education** | 3 entries | **3 entries** | **100%** |
| **Skills** | 3 entries | **3 entries** | 100% |
| **Certificates** | 4 entries | **4 entries** | 100% |

### üî¨ **Technical Breakthroughs:**
- **Color Mapping Discovery**: Found complete pdf2json color mapping:
  - `#e1e8ed` (light gray): Section headers
  - `#a8b0b5` (medium gray): Parenthetical labels  
  - `#181818` (black): Main content
  - `#b0b0b0` (gray): Location text (100% accurate detection)
  - `undefined`: Contact details (emails, URLs)
- **Outline Color Property**: Discovered `oc` property in pdf2json provides accurate color information
- **Buffer Support**: Enhanced CLI to support both file paths and Buffer input

### üöÄ **Next Phase:**
- [ ] **Expand to other profiles**: Apply this proven approach to benjamin, elisa, and krishna profiles
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Remove debug output for production use
- [ ] **Documentation update**: Document the new parsing architecture

## Recent Major Improvements (v0.3.0)

### üéØ **Parsing Accuracy Enhancements**
- **Fixed truncated highlights**: Removed arbitrary 40-line scanning limits, work section now properly extends until Education section
- **Enhanced column detection**: Better left/right column separation prevents content mixing
- **Improved location detection**: Added support for major cities (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, etc.) and complex location formats
- **Better content filtering**: Removed overly aggressive publication filtering that incorrectly excluded legitimate job descriptions

### üìä **Data Quality Improvements**
- **Structured highlights**: Workshop titles, data types, and technical content now properly separated into individual highlights instead of massive single lines
- **Automatic capitalization**: First letter of each highlight properly capitalized
- **Healthcare content recognition**: Medical terminology (Critical care, ambulatory care, etc.) no longer incorrectly filtered out

## Eric Fixture Integration (v0.5.3)

### ‚úÖ **Eric Fixture Integration**
- **Added eric test fixture**: Successfully integrated new profile with software engineering background
- **Fixed location parsing for "Bethesda, Maryland"**: Enhanced `locationKeywords` regex to include "Maryland":
  - Added "Maryland" to location keyword patterns for comma-separated location detection
  - Fixed issue where "Bethesda, Maryland" was being classified as highlights instead of location
- **Fixed basics location parsing for standalone countries**: Enhanced location parsing to handle standalone country names:
  - Added standalone country recognition to `isLocationPattern()` function
  - Added standalone country detection to label parsing to prevent inclusion in job titles
  - Fixed "United States" being incorrectly appended to job labels
- **Improved JSON Resume schema compliance**: Fixed location field format for basics section:
  - Updated standalone country parsing to use structured object format: `{ "countryCode": "United States" }`
  - Ensured compliance with JSON Resume schema requirement for location to be an object
  - Updated eric fixture expected results to match schema requirements
- **All tests passing**: 21/21 test cases now pass including eric fixture with no regressions
- **Schema validation passing**: All fixtures including eric now pass JSON Resume schema validation

## üéâ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: pdf2json Strategy Success (January 2025)**

**100% SUCCESS on Alex Profile!** The new pdf2json parsing strategy has achieved perfect accuracy:

### ‚úÖ **Perfect Results:**
- **8/8 Work Entries** extracted correctly (vs 0 with old approach)
- **3/3 Education Entries** extracted correctly (vs 0 with old approach)  
- **Complete Email Address** with smart reconstruction
- **100% Accurate Location Detection** using color-based parsing
- **Perfect Summary Extraction** (326/326 characters)
- **All Basic Information** correct (name, label, LinkedIn, etc.)

### üî¨ **Key Technical Discovery:**
- **Color-based parsing**: `outlineColor: #b0b0b0` identifies location text with 100% accuracy
- **Font-size hierarchical parsing**: Section headers, company names, positions all correctly identified
- **Smart text reconstruction**: Handles split email addresses and multi-line content
- **Buffer + File path support**: CLI now works with both input methods

This represents a complete paradigm shift from heuristic-heavy parsing to methodical, color and font-based extraction. The approach is now ready to be applied to other test profiles.
